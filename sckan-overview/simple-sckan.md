# SIMPLE-SCKAN
SIMPLE-SCKAN refers to an extension of the [SCKAN](https://sparc.science/resources/6eg3VpJbwQR4B84CjrvmyD) that allows writing queries against [NPO's](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12021-022-09566-7) core connectivity knowledge in a simplified manner. It serves as a high-level abstraction layer on top of the SCKAN for the sole purpose of making SCKAN's connectivity knowledge more accessible.
