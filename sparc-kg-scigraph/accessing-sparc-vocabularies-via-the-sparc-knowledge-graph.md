# Accessing SPARC Vocabularies via the SPARC Knowledge Graph

The best method for accessing the full SPARC Vocabularies that underlies the SPARC KG is via SciGraph.  The SPARC Vocabularies comprise the following components:

The NIFSTD Ontology:  a set of community ontologies with neuroscience specific extensions developed by the [Neuroscience Information Framework.](https://neuinfo.org)

Additional ontologies imported for the SPARC Project (e.g., FMA, EMAPA)

Additional vocabularies contributed by SPARC users for  annotating SPARC data and 3D scaffolds and to create the SPARC Connectivity Knowledge Base (SCKAN).
